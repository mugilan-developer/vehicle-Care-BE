This is a flexible React web application, customizable via the centralized configuration file `src/config.js` and uses Axios as the HTTP client.

## Instructions

By now, you should have created a Smartcar account and have obtained `client-id` and `secret`.

Set these as environment variables:
```bash
$ export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$ export REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000
$ export REACT_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:8000
```

To install the required dependencies and run this React app:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

In production, replace the localhosts with the correct client and server urls.

## About the code
